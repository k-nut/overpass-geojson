# overpass-geojson admin scripts

The scripts should be called from the root folder (so e.g. `./admin/upload.sh`)

`./admin/upload.sh` uploads the current folder contents as a new version.

`./admin/show_logs.sh` shows the latest logs (note: this requires the python `awslogs` tool which cann be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
